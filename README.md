**What it does**

This mod adds fog to some stages and upscales nearly all the game textures up
to 4x times, and applies some image effects on them.

**Setup**

Put it bellow Cutscene Revamp, HD GUI and Menu Overhaul. Check the
configuration screenshot, or else the cutscenes and the character life icons
are not going to be affected, and the main screen will look buggy.
